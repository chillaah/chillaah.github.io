I am currently pursuing BE Computer & Software Systems (Hons) @ [Queensland University of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/). 

Previously (2022), I was a Summer Robotics Intern @ [CSIRO's Data61 Robotics & Autonomous Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/data61/) working on Quadrupedal Terrain Traversability.
